# Joyent CloudAPI

This is the reference documentation for the CloudAPI that is part of Joyent's
SmartDataCenter 6 product.  This guide provides descriptions of the APIs
available, as well as supporting information such as how to use the SDK(s), 
command line interface (CLI),
and where to find more information.

For more information about this product visit
[Joyent SmartDataCenter](http://www.joyent.com/software/smartdatacenter).

This document refers to SmartDataCenter 6.5.


## Conventions

Any content formatted like this is a command-line example that you
can run from a shell:

    $ sdc-listmachines

All other examples and information are formatted like this:

    GET /my/machines HTTP/1.1



# Introduction to CloudAPI

## What is CloudAPI?

CloudAPI is the API you use to interact with the SmartDataCenter product. Using
CloudAPI, you can:

* Provision new machines (both SmartMachines and traditional Virtual Machines)
* Manage your account credentials
* Create custom analytics for monitoring your infrastructure

## How do I access CloudAPI?

CloudAPI is available as a REST API, and you can access it using:

* SmartDataCenter Customer Portal
* [Command line interface](https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc) (CLI)
* [node.js SDK](https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc)
* REST API

If you don't want to write any code, use the CloudAPI CLI. The CLI
lets you use command line tools to perform every action available in
the SDK and in the REST API.


# Getting Started

The CloudAPI command line interface (CLI) requires Node.js and npm to run.

You can get Node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) as source code
and as precompiled packages for Windows and Macintosh. (npm has been included
in the Node.js distribution since version 0.6.3.)

Once you've installed Node.js and npm, install the CloudAPI CLI like this:

    $ npm install smartdc -g

You will also want to install [jsontool](https://github.com/trentm/json), a tool that
makes it easier to work with JSON-formatted output. You can install it like this:

    $ npm install jsontool -g

In both cases the `-g` switch installs the tools globally,
usually in `/usr/local/bin`,
so that you can use them easily from the command line.

## Generate an SSH key

The CloudAPI CLI does not allow you to use HTTP Basic Authentication, as it is
a weak security mechanism.  Additionally, to interact with provisioned machines,
you need an SSH key to login.

If you haven't already generated an SSH key (required to use both
SSH and HTTP Signing), run the following command:

    $ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa

This will prompt you with a place to save the key. You should probably just
accept the defaults, as many programs (SSH and SDC CLI) will first look for a
file called ~/.ssh/id_rsa.

## Set Up your CLI

This step is optional if you've already uploaded an SSH key to your account.
Otherwise, this step will 'bootstrap' your account using your SmartDataCenter
username and password so you can leverage the rest of the CLI.

    $ sdc-setup https://api.example.com
    Username (login): demo
    Password:
    SSH public key: (/Users/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

The URL is the URL of the CloudAPI endpoint. For example, one of the CloudAPI
endpoints for the JoyentCloud is `https://us-west-1.api.joyentcloud.com`.
(Each datacenter in a cloud has its own CloudAPI endpoint.)
A different cloud that uses SmartDataCenter
would have a different endpoint. In this document, we'll use
`api.example.com` as the endpoint.

Note that CloudAPI always uses secure HTTP, which means that the endpoint URL
must begin with `https`.

Use the login for your SmartDataCenter account and the password that goes with
it.  For the SSH public key, the default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub; if you're using
a different key with SmartDataCenter, enter the path to the *public* key.

If you get an error message that says `This ssh key is in use`, it means that the key is already associated with your SmartDataCenter account. Go ahead an set up the environment variables described next.

`sdc-setup` will print some messages about setting environment variables.
While these are optional, we recommend you set them so you don't need to enter
additional parameters to the CLI for future requests.

## Working with the CLI

For a complete list of CloudAPI CLI commands available see [Appendix D: CloudAPI CLI Commands](#appendix-d-cloudapi-cli-commands).

To get help on command, use the `--help` flag. For example:

    $ sdc-listdatacenters --help
    sdc-listdatacenters [--account string] [--debug boolean] [--help boolean]
    [--identity path] [--keyId string] [--url url] 

You can set environment variables for the following flags so that you don't have
to type them for each request:

|| **CLI Flag** || **Description** || **Environment Variable** ||
||--account<br/>-a||Login name (account)||SDC\_CLI\_ACCOUNT||
||--keyId<br/>-k||Name of the key to use for signing||SDC\_CLI\_KEY\_ID||
||--url<br/>-u||URL of the CloudAPI endpoint||SDC\_CLI\_URL||
||--identity<br/>-i||Path to the location of your SSH key.<br/>On a Macintosh, this is usually `/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa`||SDC\_CLI\_IDENTITY||

Note that you can use the short form of flags as well. For instance, you 
can use the `-a` or the `--account` flag.


## Provision a new SmartMachine

To provision a new SmartMachine with the default settings, you can simply run:

    $ sdc-createmachine -n getting-started

You can use the `-n` flag to name your machine.
If you do not specify a name, SmartDataCenter will generate a name for you.  You
can retrieve the status of your SmartMachine like:

    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started

    [
      {
        "id": "0b97c186-05a5-4113-b05f-3e597e3cf038",
        "name": getting-started",
        "owner": demo",
        "type": "smartmachine",
        "state": "running",
        "dataset": "smartos-1.3.13",
        "ips": [
          "10.88.88.50"
        ],
        "memory": 128,
        "disk": 5120,
        "metadata": {},
        "created": "2011-06-27T19:52:40+00:00",
        "updated": "2011-06-27T20:08:55+00:00"
      }
    ]


Once the state is "running", you can login to your new machine (assuming it's
a Unix-based machine), with the following:

    $ ssh-add
    $ ssh -A admin@10.88.88.50

Those two commands set up your SSH Agent (which has some magical properties,
such as the ability for the CLI to work on your SmartMachine without keys), and
logs you in as the `admin` user on that machine.  Note that the `admin` user has
password-less sudo capabilities, so you may want to set up some less priviledged
users.  The SSH keys on your account will allow you to login as any OS user on
a SmartMachine.

Now that we've done some basics with a SmartMachine, let's introduce a few
concepts in case you want to be cooler than the defaults.

<a name="dataset-description"></a>
### Datasets

Datasets can be any image available in your SmartDataCenter cloud.  By
default, you can use SmartOS or node.js datasets (the node.js dataset being a
superset of SmartOS).  Your SmartDataCenter cloud may have other datasets
available, such as Linux or Windows datasets.  To list what datasets are
available in your datacenter, run:

    $ sdc-listdatasets

Datasets are the SmartDataCenter name for the "image" of your machine. To
specify a dataset, use the special dataset urn syntax recognized by
SmartDataCenter.  The urn syntax is specified as: `cloud:vendor:name:version`.

For example, to provision a node.js machine, use:

    $ sdc-createmachine -e sdc:sdc:nodejs:1.2.0 -n getting-started-nodejs

<a name="packages-description"></a>
### Packages

You can list packages available in your cloud with:

    $ sdc-listpackages

Packages are the SmartDataCenter name for the "size" of your machine.  Packages
are provided so that you do not need to select individual settings, such as
memory or disk.  To provision a new SmartMachine with more memory, for example,
try:

    $ sdc-createmachine -e sdc:sdc:nodejs:1.2.0 -n big-nodejs -p regular_1024

## Managing SSH keys

For machines of type `smartmachine`, you can manage the SSH keys that allow
login to the OS from Cloud API (Virtual Machines are static, and whatever keys
are in your account at machine creation time are used).  To rotate keys, for
example, run:

    $ sdc-createkey -n my_other_rsa_key ~/.ssh/my_other_rsa_key.pub

The `-n` option sets the name of the key. If you don't provide one, Cloud API
sets it to the name of the file. In this case `my_other_rsa_key.pub`.

To use the new key, you will need to update the environment variables:

    $ export SDC_CLI_KEY_ID=my_other_rsa_key

If the key is stored in a file other than `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, you will also need
to add it to the SSH Agent and to set the `SDC_CLI_IDENTITY` variable:

    $ export SDC_CLI_IDENTITY=~/.ssh/my_other_rsa_key
    $ ssh-add $SDC_CLI_IDENTITY

At this point you could delete your other key from the system; see [Cleaning Up](#cleaning-up)
for a quick example.

## Creating Analytics

Now that you've got a SmartMachine up and running, and you logged in and did
whatever it is you thought was awesome, let's create an instrumentation to
monitor performance.  Analytics are one of the most powerful features of
SmartDataCenter, so for more information, be sure to read
[Appendix B: Cloud Analytics](#appendix-b-cloud-analytics) on Analytics in this document.
Anyway, let's instrument something!

To get started for now, let's create an instrumentation on our network bytes:

    $ sdc-createinstrumentation -m nic -s vnic_bytes

Great, now ssh back into your machine, and do something silly like:

    $ wget joyent.com
    $ ping -I 1 joyent.com

Now, go ahead and run:

    $ sdc-getinstrumentation -v 1

Where `1` is the id you got back from `sdc-createinstrumentation`.  You should
be able to run this a few times and see the changes.  This is just a starting
point, for a full discssion of analytics, be sure to read
[Appendix B: Cloud Analytics](#appendix-b-cloud-analytics).

## Cleaning up

After going through the Getting Started section, you should now have at least
one SSH key, one machine and one instrumentation.  The rest of the commands
assume you have [jsontool](https://github.com/trentm/json) installed.

### Deleting Instrumentations

Before cleaning up your machines, let's get rid of the instrumentation we
created:

    $ sdc-deleteinstrumentation 1

### Deleting Machines

Machines need to be shutdown before you can delete them, so let's do some fancy
shell work to do that:

    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started | json 0.id | xargs sdc-stopmachine

Now, go ahead and check the state a few times until it's `stopped`.  Then go
ahead and run `sdc-deletemachine`.

    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started | json 0.state
    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started | json 0.id | xargs sdc-deletemachine

### Deleting keys

Finally, you probably have two SSH keys uploaded to SmartDataCenter after going
through the guide, so go ahead and delete the one we setup:

    $ sdc-deletekey id_rsa



# API Introduction

CloudAPI is available as an HTTP standard REST API.  You can work with the REST
API by either talking directly to it via tooling you already know about (such as
curl, et al), or by using the CloudAPI SDK from Joyent.  The CloudAPI SDK is
available as an npm module, which you can install with:

    $ npm install smartdc

The rest of this document will show all APIs in terms of both the raw HTTP
specification, the SDK API, and the CLI command.

## Issuing Requests

All HTTP calls to CloudAPI must be made over SSL/TLS, and requests must carry at
least two headers (in addition to standard HTTP headers): `Authorization` and
`X-Api-Version` header.  The details are explained below.  In addition to these
headers, any requests requiring content must be sent in an acceptable scheme to
CloudAPI.  Details are also below.

### Content-Type

For requests requiring content, you can send parameters encoded with
`application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or
`multipart/form-data`.  Joyent recommends `application/json`.  The value of the
`Accept` header determines the encoding of content returned in responses.
CloudAPI supports `application/json` response encodings only.

For exmaple, all of the following are valid calls:

Query String (on the uri):

    POST /my/keys?name=rsa&key=... HTTP/1.1
    Host: joyent.com
    Authorization: ...
    Content-Length: 0

Form encoded in the body:

    POST /my/keys HTTP/1.1
    Host: joyent.com
    Authorization: ...
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 123

    name=rsa&key=...

JSON in the body:

    POST /my/keys HTTP/1.1
    Host: joyent.com
    Authorization: ...
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 123

    {"name":"rsa","key":"..."}

### Authorization

All API calls to the CloudAPI require an Authorization header, which supports
multiple ["schemes"](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617). Currently CloudAPI
supports two Authentication mechanisms:

* Basic Authentication Scheme
* HTTP Signature Authentication Scheme

The Basic Authentication Scheme is outlined in
[RFC 2617](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617).  The HTTP Signature
Authentication Scheme is outlined in [Appendix C](#Appendix-C).

In order to leverage Basic Authentication, simply use your SmartDataCenter login
and password.  For example, if your username is `demo` and your password is
`secret`, the value of the Authorization header would be:

    Authorization: Basic ${Base64(demo:secret)}

In order to leverage HTTP Signature Authentication, only RSA signing mechanisms
are supported, and your keyId must be equal to the path returned from a
`ListKeys` API call.  For example, if your SmartDataCenter login is `demo`, and
you've uploaded an RSA SSH key with the name `foo`, an Authorization header
would look like:

    Authorization: Signature keyId=/demo/keys/foo,algorithm="rsa-sha256" ${Base64($Date)}

The default value to sign for CloudAPI requests is simply the value of the HTTP
`Date` header.  For more informaton on the Date header value, see
[RFC 2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.18).  All requests to
CloudAPI using the Signature authentication scheme *must* send a Date header.
Note that clock skew will be enforced to 300s (positive or negative) of the
value sent.

Because the security value of HTTP Signature Authentication is much stronger
than HTTP Basic Authentication, Joyent recommends you send all requests using
the Signature mechanism.  Full support for this authentication scheme is in the
CloudAPI SDK; additionally, a reference implementation for node.js is available
in the NPM `http-signature`, which you can install with:

    npm install http-signature

### X-Api-Version

The CloudAPI is strongly versioned, and all requests *must* specify a version of
the API.  The `X-Api-Version` header is expected to carry a
[semver](http://semver.org/) string that the client wants to use,with the
additional twist that your client can specify ranges of versions to support, as
you can with NPM.   For details on how to specify ranges, check
[node-semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver).  A couple examples:

    X-Api-Version: ~6.5
    X-Api-Version: >=6.5.0

Joyent recommends you set the X-Api-Version header to `~6.5`; each service
release of SmartDataCenter will increment the `patch` version; any major
releases of SmartDataCenter will increment either the `minor` or `major`
version.


### Using cURL with CloudAPI

Since [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) is commonly used to script requests to web
services, here's a simple alias you can use to wrap cURL to communicate with
CloudAPI:

    $ alias cloudapi='curl -is -u demo:secret -H "Accept: application/json" -H "X-Api-Version: ~6.5"'

Then you could try:

    $ cloudapi https://api.example.com/my/machines

That step will use Basic Authentication; if you want to leverage cURL and HTTP
Signature Authentication, you'll need to do a little scripting of `date`,
`openssl` and `curl`.  Here's a sample function:

    $ function cloudapi() {
      local now=`date -u "+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT"` ;
      local signature=`echo ${now} | tr -d '\n' | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ~/.ssh/id_rsa | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'` ;

      curl -is -H "Accept: application/json" -H "x-api-version: ~6.5" -H "Date: ${now}" -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"/demo/keys/id_rsa\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\" ${signature}" --url https://api.example.com$@ ;
      echo "";
    }

With that function, you could just do:

    $ cloudapi /my/machines

## CloudAPI HTTP Responses

As indicated above, CloudAPI returns all response objects as `application/json`
encoded HTTP bodies.  In addition to the content object, all response have
the following headers:

||**Header**||**Description**||
||Date||When the response was sent (RFC 1123 format)||
||X-Api-Version||The exact version of the CloudAPI server you talked to||
||X-RequestId||A unique id for this request; you should log this||
||X-Response-Time||How long the server took to process your request (ms)||

If there is content, you can expect:

||**Header**||**Description**||
||Content-Length||How much content, in bytes||
||Content-Type||Formatting of the response (almost always application/json)||
||Content-MD5||An MD5 checksum of the response; you should check this||

### HTTP Status Codes

Your client should check for each of the following status codes from any API
request:

||**Response**||**Code**||**Description**||
||400||Bad Request||Invalid HTTP Request||
||401||Unauthorized||Either no Authorization header was sent, or invalid credentials were used||
||403||Forbidden||No permissions to the specified resource||
||404||Not Found||Something you requested was not found||
||405||Method Not Allowed||Method not supported for the given resource||
||406||Not Acceptable||Try sending a different Accept header||
||409||Conflict||Most likely invalid or missing parameters||
||413||Request Entity Too Large||You sent too much data||
||415||Unsupported Media Type||You encoded your request in a format we don't understand||
||420||Slow Down||You're sending too many requests||
||449||Retry With||Invalid Version header; try with a different X-Api-Version string||
||503||Service Unavailable||Either there's no capacity in this datacenter, or we're in a maintenance window||

### Error Responses

In the event of an error, CloudAPI will return a standard error response object
of the scheme:

    {
      "code": "CODE",
      "message": "human readable string"
    }

Where the code element is one of:

||**Code**||**Description**||
||BadRequest||You sent bad HTTP||
||InternalError||Something was wrong on our end||
||InvalidArgument||You sent bad arguments or a bad value for an argument||
||InvalidCredentials||Try authenticating correctly||
||InvalidHeader||You sent a bad HTTP header||
||InvalidVersion||You sent a bad X-Api-Version string||
||MissingParameter||You didn't send a required parameter||
||NotAuthorized||You don't have access to the requested resource||
||RequestThrottled||You got throttled||
||RequestTooLarge||You sent too much request data||
||RequestMoved||HTTP Redirect||
||ResourceNotFound||What you asked for wasn't found||
||UnknownError||Something completely unexpected happened.||

Clients are expected to check HTTP status code first, and if in the 4xx range,
they can leverage the codes above.

# Machines

## ListMachines (GET /:login/machines)

Lists all machines we have on record for your account.  If you have a large
number of machines, you can filter using the input parameters listed below.

You can paginate this API by passing in `offset`, and `limit`.  HTTP responses
will contain the additional headers `x-resource-count` and `x-query-limit`. If
`x-resource-count` is less than `x-query-limit`, you're done, otherwise call the
API again with `offset` set to `offset + limit`.

Note that there is a `HEAD /:login/machines` form of this API so you can
retrieve the number of machines.

### Inputs

||name||String||Machine name to find (will make your list size 1, or 0)||
||dataset||String||dataset ID; returns machines provisioned with that dataset||
||state||String||The current state of the machine||
||memory||Number||The current size of the RAM deployed for the machine (Mb)||
||tombstone||Number||Include machines destroyed in the last N minutes||
||limit||Number||Return N machines; default is 1000 (which is also the maximum allowable result set size)||
||offset||Number||Get the next $limit of machines starting at this point||
||tag.$name||String||An arbitrary set of tags can be used to query on, assuming they are prefixed with "tag."||
||credentials||Boolean||Whether to include the generated credentials for machines, if present. Defaults to false.||

### Returns

An array of machine objects, which contain:

||id||String||The globally unique id for this machine||
||name||String||The "friendly" name for this machine||
||type||String||Whether this is a smartmachine or virtualmachine||
||state||String||The current state of this machine||

||metadata||Object[String => String]||Any "extra" metadata this machine has||
||created||Date (ISO8601)||When this machine was created||
||updated||Date (ISO8601)||When this machine was updated||

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

||**Error Code**||**Description**||
||ResourceNotFound||If :login does not exist||
||InvalidArgument||If one of the input parameters was invalid||

### CLI Command

Getting all machines:

    $ sdc-listmachines

Getting all SmartMachines:

    $ sdc-listmachines -y smartmachine

Getting all SmartMachines that are currently running:

    $ sdc-listmachines -y smartmachine -s running

Getting all SmartMachines that are currently running and have 256 Mb of memory:

    $ sdc-listmachines -y smartmachine -s running -m 256

Getting all SmartMachines that are currently running, with 256 Mb of memory tagged 'test':

    $ sdc-listmachines -y smartmachine -s running -m 256 -t group=test

Basically, the CLI has sane parameters that let you filter on anything in the
API, and you can combine them.  run `$ sdc-listmachines -h` to see all the
options.

## CreateMachine (POST /:login/machines)

Allows you to provision a machine.  Note that if you do not specify a package
and/or dataset, you'll get the datacenter defaults for each.  If you do not
specify a name, CloudAPI will generate a random one for you.  Your machine
will initially be not available for login (SmartDataCenter must provision and
boot it).  You can poll [GetMachine](#GetMachine) for status.  When the `state`
field is equal to `running`, you can login.

With regards to login, if the machine is of type `smartmachine`, you can use any
of the SSH keys managed under the keys section of CloudAPI to login, as any
POSIX user on the OS.  You can add/remove them over time, and the machine will
automatically work with that set.

If the the machine is a virtualmachine, and of a UNIX-derived OS (e.g. Linux),
you *must* have keys uploaded before provisioning; that entire set of keys will
be written out to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys, and you can ssh in using one of
those.  Changing the keys over time under your account will not affect the
running virtual machine in any way; those keys are statically written at
provisioning-time only, and you will need to manually manage them.

If the dataset you create a machine from is set to generate passwords for you,
the username/password pairs will be returned in the metadata response as a
nested object, like:

    "metadata": {
      "credentials": {
        "root": "s8v9kuht5e",
        "admin": "mf4bteqhpy"
      }
    }

You cannot overwrite the `credentials` key in CloudAPI.

More generally, the metadata keys can be set either at machine creation time
or after the fact.  You must either pass in plain string values, or a JSON
encoded string. On metadata retrieval, you will get back a "complex" JSON
object.

### Inputs

||name||String||friendly name for this machine; default is a randomly generated name||
||package||String||Name of the package to use on provisioning; default is indicated in ListPackages||
||dataset||String||dataset URN; default is indicated in ListDatasets||
||metadata.$name||String||An arbitrary set of metadata key/value pairs can be set at provision time, but they must be prefixed with "metadata."||
||tag.$name||String||An arbitrary set of tags can be set at provision time, but they must be prefixed with "tag."||

### Returns

||id||String||The globally unique id for this machine||
||name||String||The "friendly" name for this machine||
||type||String||Whether this is a smartmachine or virtualmachine||
||state||String||The current state of this machine||
||dataset||URN||The dataset urn this machine was provisioned with||
||memory||Number||The amount of memory this machine has (Mb)||
||disk||Number||The amount of disk this machine has (Gb)||
||ips||Array[String]||The IP addresses this machine has||
||metadata||Object[String => String]||Any "extra" metadata this machine has||
||created||Date (ISO8601)||When this machine was created||
||updated||Date (ISO8601)||When this machine was updated||

# Analytics

It is strongly recommended that before you read the API documentation for Analytics,
you first read through [Appendix B: Cloud Analytics](#appendix-b-cloud-analytics).
Most supporting documentation and explanation of types and interactions are
described there.

## DescribeAnalytics (GET /:login/analytics)

Supports retrieving the "schema" for instrumentations that can be created using
the analytics endpoint.

### Inputs

* None

### Returns

A large object that reflects the analytics available to you. Each of the items
listed below is actually an object; the "keys" in each are what can be used. For
example, in 'modules', you'll get something like:

    {
      "modules": {
        "cpu": { "label": "CPU" },
        "memory": { "label": "Memory" },
        ...
      },
      "fields": {
        "hostname": {
          "label": "server hostname",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "label": "time on CPU",
          "type": "time"
        },
        "zonename": {
          "label": "zone name",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "types": {
        "string": {
          "arity": "discrete",
          "unit": ""
        },
        "size": {
          "arity": "numeric",
          "unit": "bytes",
          "abbr": "B",
          "base": 2,
        },
        "time": {
          "arity": "numeric",
          "unit": "seconds",
          "abbr": "s",
          "base": 10,
          "power": -9,
        }
      },
      "metrics": [ {
        "module": "cpu",
        "stat": "thread_executions",
        "label": "thread executions",
        "interval": "interval",
        "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename", "runtime" ],
        "unit": "operations"
      }, {
        "module": "memory",
        "stat": "rss",
        "label": "resident set size",
        "interval": "point",
        "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename" ],
        "type": "size"
      } ],
      "transformations": {
        "geolocate": {
          "label": "geolocate IP addresses",
          "fields": [ "raddr" ]
        },
        "reversedns": {
          "label": "reverse dns IP addresses lookup",
          "fields": [ "raddr" ]
        }
      }
    }

You can use `cpu`, `memory` as module parameters to the other APIs.

||**Field**||**Type**||
||modules||Object||
||fields||Object||
||types||Object||
||types||Object||
||metrics||Object||
||transformations||Object||

Each of these objects is discussed below:

#### Modules

Each metric is identified by both a `module` and `stat` name.  Modules exist
as namespaces to organize metrics.  Module configuration looks like this:

    "modules": {
      "cpu": {
        "label": "CPU" },
        "memory": { "label": "Memory" },
        ...
      }

Each module has a name (its key in the "modules" structure) and an object with a
single field called `label` which is its human-readable label.

#### Metrics

Metrics describe quantities which can be measured by the system.  Data is not
collected for metrics unless an instrumentation has been configured for it.

    "metrics": [ {
      "module": "cpu",
      "stat": "thread_executions",
      "label": "thread executions",
      "interval": "interval",
      "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename", "runtime" ],
      "unit": "operations"
    }, {
      "module": "memory",
      "stat": "rss",
      "label": "resident set size",
      "interval": "point",
      "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename" ],
      "type": "size"
    } ]

Each metric has the following properties:

||**Field**||**Type**||**Description**||
||module||String||With stat, a unique metric identifier||
||stat||String||With module, a unique metric identifier||
||label||String||A human-readable metric description||
||interval||String||either "interval" or "point", indicating whether the value of this metric covers activity over an *interval* of time or a snapshot of state at a particular `point*` in time||
||fields||Array||a list of fields to be used for predicates and decompositions||
||type||String||type or unit used to display labels for values of this metric||

#### Fields

Fields represent metadata by which data points can be filtered or decomposed.


    "fields": {
      "pid": {
        "label": "process identifier",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "execname": {
        "label": "application name",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "psargs": {
        "label": "process arguments",
        "type": "string"
      },
      ...

Each field has the following properties:

||**Field**||**Type**||**Description**||
||label||String||human-readable description of the field||
||type||String||type of the field, which determines how to label it as well as whether the field is numeric or discrete||

Fields are either numeric or discrete based on the "arity" of their type.

###### Numeric fields

* In predicates, values of numeric fields can be compared using numeric equality
  and inequality operators (=, <, >, etc.).
* In decompositions, a numeric field yields a numeric decomposition (see
  "Numeric decompositions" above).

###### Discrete fields

* In predicates, values of discrete fields can only be compared using string
  equality.
* In decompositions, a discrete field yields a discrete decomposition (see
  "Discrete decompositions" above).

Note that some fields look like numbers but are used by software as identifiers
and so are actually discrete fields.  Examples include process identifiers,
which are numbers but for which it doesn't generally make sense to compare
using inequalities or decompose to get a numeric distribution.

#### Types

Types are used with both metrics and fields for two purposes: to hint to clients
at how to best label values, and to distinguish between numeric and discrete
quantities.

    "types": {
      "string": {
        "arity": "discrete",
        "unit": ""
      },
      "size": {
        "arity": "numeric",
        "unit": "bytes",
        "abbr": "B",
        "base": 2,
      },
      "time": {
        "arity": "numeric",
        "unit": "seconds",
        "abbr": "s",
        "base": 10,
        "power": -9,
       }
     }

Each type has the following properties:

||**Field**||**Type**||**Description**||
||arity||String||indicates whether values of this type are "discrete" (e.g., identifiers and other strings), or "numeric" (e.g., measurements)||
||unit||String||base unit for this type||
||abbr||String||(optional) abbreviation for this base unit for this type||
||base||Number||indicates that when labeled, this quantity is usually labeled with SI prefixes corresponding to powers of the specified base||
||power||Number||this indicates that the raw values of this type are expressed in units corresponding to base raised to power||

#### Transformations

Transformations are post-processing functions that can be applied to data when
it's retrieved.

    "transformations": {
      "geolocate": {
        "label": "geolocate IP addresses",
        "fields": [ "raddr" ]
      },
      "reversedns": {
        "label": "reverse dns IP addresses lookup",
        "fields": [ "raddr" ]
      }
    }

Each transformation has the following properties:

||**Field**||**Type**||**Description**||
||label||String||Human readable string||
||fields||Array||list of field names that can be transformed||

The above transformations transform values of the "raddr" (remote address) field
of any metric to either an object with geolocation details or an array of
reverse-DNS hostnames, respectively.

# Appendix B: Cloud Analytics

Cloud Analytics (CA) provides deep observability for systems and applications in
a SmartDataCenter cloud.  The CA service enables you to dynamically instrument
systems in the cloud to collect performance data that can be visualized in
real-time (through the portal) or collected using the API and analyzed later by
custom tools.  This data can be collected and saved indefinitely for
capacity planning and other historical analysis.

## Building blocks: metrics, instrumentations, and fields

A **metric** is any quantity that can be instrumented using CA.  For examples:

* Disk I/O operations
* Kernel thread executions
* TCP connections established
* MySQL queries
* HTTP server operations
* System load average

Each metric also defines which **fields** are available when data is collected.
These fields can be used to filter or decompose data.  For example, the Disk I/O
operations metric provides fields "hostname" (for the current server's
hostname) and "disk" (for the name of the disk actually performing an
operation), which allows users to filter out data from a physical server or
break out the number of operations by disk.

You can list the available metrics using the
[DescribeAnalytics](#DescribeAnalytics) API.

    {
      "metrics": [
        {
          "module": "fs",
          "stat": "logical_ops",
          "label": "logical filesystem operations",
          "interval": "interval",
          "fields": ["pid","execname",...,"fstype","optype","latency"],
          "unit": "operations"
        }, ...  ], ...
    }

The "module" and "stat" properties identify the metric.

When you want to actually gather data for a metric, you create an
**instrumentation**.  The instrumentation specifies:

* which metric to collect
* an optional **predicate** based on the metric's fields (e.g., only collect
  data from certain hosts, or data for certain operations)
* an optional **decomposition** based on the metric's fields (e.g., break down
  the results by server hostname)
* how frequently to aggregate data (e.g., every second, every hour, etc.)
* how much data to keep (e.g., 10 minutes' worth, 6 months' worth, etc.)
* other configuration options

Continuing the above example, if the system provides the metric "FS Operations"
with fields "optype" and "latency", an example instrumentation might
specify:

* to collect data for the FS Operations" metric (the *metric*)
* to collect only data from for read operations (a *predicate*)
* to break out the results by latency (a *decomposition*)

    $ sdc-createinstrumentation -m fs -s logical_ops -n latency -p '{"eq": ["optype","read"]}'

When we create an instrumentation, the system dynamically instruments the
relevant software and starts gathering data.  The data is made available
immediately in real-time.  To get the data for a particular point in time, you
retrieve the **value** of the instrumentation for that time:

    $ sdc-getinstrumentation -v 4
    {
      "value": [
        [ [ 17000, 17999 ], 12 ],
        [ [ 18000, 18999 ], 12 ],
        ...
      ],
      "transformations": {},
      "start_time": 1309383598,
      "duration": 1,
      "nsources": 1,
      "minreporting": 1,
      "requested_start_time": 1309383598,
      "requested_duration": 1,
      "requested_end_time": 1309383599
    }


To summarize: *metrics* define what data the system is capable of reporting.
*Fields* enhance the raw numbers with additional metadata about each event that
can be used for filtering and decomposition.  *Instrumentations* specify which
metrics to actually collect, what additional information to collect from each
metric, and how to store that data.  When you want to retrieve that data, you
query the service for the *value* of the instrumentation.

## Values and visualizations

We showed above how fields can be used to decompose results.  Let's look at that
in more detail.  We'll continue using the "FS Operations" metric with
fields "optype".

### Scalar values

Suppose we create an instrumentation with no filter and no decomposition.  Then
the value of the instrumentation for a particular time interval might look
something like this (omitting several unrelated properties):

    {
      start_time: 1308789361,
      duration: 1,
      value: 573
    }

In this case, `start_time` denotes the start of the time interval in Unix time,
`duration` denotes the length of the interval, and `value` denotes the actual
value, which is 573.  This means that 573 FS operations completed on all
systems in the cloud between times 1308789361 and 1308789362.

### Discrete decompositions

Now suppose we create a new instrumentation with a decomposition by `execname`.
Then the raw value might look something like this:

    {
      start_time: 1308789361,
      duration: 1,
      value: {
        ls: 1,
        cat: 49,
        ...
      }
    }

We call the decomposition by `execname` a **discrete decomposition** because the
possible values of execname ("ls", "cat", ...) are not numbers.

### Numeric decompositions

It's useful to decompose some metrics by numeric fields.  For example, you might
want to view FS operations decomposed by latency (how long the operation
took).  The result is a *distribution*, which groups nearby latencies into
buckets and shows the number of disk I/O operations that fell into each bucket.
The result looks like this:

    {
      "start_time": 1308863061,
      "duration": 1,
      "value": [
        [ [ 53000, 53999 ], 4 ],
        [ [ 54000, 54999 ], 4 ],
        [ [ 55000, 55999 ], 7 ],
        ...
        [ [ 810000, 819999 ], 1 ]
      ]
    }

That data indicates that at time 1308863061, the system completed:

* 4 requests with latency between 53 and 54 microseconds,
* 4 requests with latency between 54 and 55 microseconds,
* 7 requests between 55 and 56 microseconds, and so on, and finally
* 1 request with latency between 810 and 820 microseconds.

This type of instrumentation is called a **numeric decomposition**.

### Combining decompositions

It's possible to combine a single discrete and numeric decomposition to produce
an object mapping discrete key to numeric distribution, whose value looks like
this:

    {
      "start_time": 1308863799,
      "duration": 1,
      "value": {
        "ls": [
          [ [ 110000, 119999 ], 1 ],
          [ [ 120000, 129999 ], 1 ],
          ...
          [ [ 420000, 429999 ], 1 ],
          [ [ 25000000, 25999999 ], 1 ]
        ]
      }
    }

As we will see, this data allows clients to visualize the distribution of I/O
latency and then highlight individual programs in the distribution (or whatever
field you broke it down along).

### Value-related properties

We can now explain several of the instrumentation properties shown previously:

* `value-dimension`: the number of dimensions in returned values, which is
  the number of decompositions specified in the instrumentation, plus 1.
  Instrumentations with no decompositions have dimension 1 (scalar values).
  Instrumentations with a single discrete or numeric decomposition have value 2
  (vector values).  Instrumentations with both a discrete and numeric
  decomposition have value 3 (vector of vectors).
* `value-arity`: describes the format of individual values
    * `scalar`: the value is a scalar value (a number)
    * `discrete-decomposition`: the value is an object mapping discrete keys to
      scalars
    * `numeric-decomposition`: the value is either an object (really an array of
      arrays) mapping buckets (numeric ranges) to scalars, or an object mapping
      discrete keys to such an object.  That is, a numeric decomposition is one
      which contains at the leaf a distribution of numbers.

The arity serves as a hint to visualization clients: scalars are typically
rendered as line or bar graphs, discrete decompositions are rendered as stacked
or separate line or bar graphs, and numeric decompositions are rendered as
heatmaps.

### Predicate Syntax

Predicates allow you to filter out data points based on the *fields* of a
metric.  For example, instead of looking at FS operations for your whole
cloud, you may only care about operations with latency over 100ms, or on a
particular machine.

Predicates are represented as JSON objects using an LISP-like syntax.  The
primary goal for predicate syntax is to be very easy to construct and parse
automatically to enable people to build tools to work with them.

The following leaf predicates are available:

`{ eq: [ fieldname, value ] }`: equality (string or number, as appropriate).
`{ ne: [ fieldname, value ] }`: inequality (string or number, as appropriate).
`{ le: [ fieldname, value ] }`: less than or equal to (numbers only).
`{ lt: [ fieldname, value ] }`: less than (numbers only).
`{ ge: [ fieldname, value ] }`: greater than or equal to (numbers only).
`{ gt: [ fieldname, value ] }`: greater than (numbers only).

Additionally, the following compound predicates are available:

`{ and: [ predicate, ... ] }`: all of subpredicates must be true.
`{ or: [ predicate, ... ] }`: at least one of subpredicates must be true.

All of these can be combined to form complex filters for drilling down.  For
example, this predicate:

    {
      and: {
        { eq: [ "execname", "mysqld" ] }
        { gt: [ "latency", 100000000 ] },
        { or: [
          { eq: [ "hostname", "host1" ] },
          { eq: [ "hostname", "host2" ] },
          { eq: [ "hostname", "host3" ] }
        ] },
      }
    }

This predicate could be used with the "logical filesystem operations" metric to
identify file operations performed by MySQL on machines "host1", "host2", or
"host3" that took longer than 100ms.

### Heatmaps

Up to this point we have been showing **raw values**, which are JSON
representations of the data exactly as gathered by Cloud Analytics.
However, the service may provide other representations of the same data.  For
numeric decompositions, the service provides several **heatmap** resources that
generate heatmaps, like this one:

<img src="media/img/heatmap.png" />

Like raw values, heatmap values are returned using JSON, but instead of
specifying a `value` property, they specify an `image` property whose contents
are a base64-encoded PNG image.  For details, see the API reference.  Using the
API, it's possible to specify the size of the image, the colors used, which
values of the discrete decomposition to select, and many other properties
controlling the final result.

Heatmaps also provide a resource for getting the details of a particular heatmap
bucket, which looks like this:

    {
      "start_time": 1308865184,
      "duration": 60,
      "nbuckets": 100,
      "width": 600,
      "height": 300,
      "bucket_time": 1308865185,
      "bucket_ymin": 10000,
      "bucket_ymax": 19999,
      "present": {
        "ls": 5,
        "cat": 57
      },
      "total": 1,
    }

This example indicates the following about the particular heatmap bucket we
clicked on:

* the time represented by the bucket is 1308865185
* the bucket covers a latency range between 10 and 20 microseconds
* at that time and latency range, program `ls` completed 5 operations and
  program `cat` completed 57 operations.

This level of detail is critical for understanding hot spots or other patterns
in the heatmap.

## Data granularity and data retention

By default, CA collects and saves data each second for 10 minutes.  So if you
create an instrumentation for FS operations, the service will save
the per-second number of FS operations going back for the last 10
minutes.  These parameters are configurable using the following instrumentation
properties:

* `granularity`: how frequently to aggregate data, in seconds.  The default is 1
  second.  For example, a value of 300 means to aggregate every 5 minutes' worth
  of data into a single data point.  The smaller this value, the more space the
  raw data takes up.  `granularity` cannot be changed after an instrumentation
  is created.
* `retention-time`: how long, in seconds, to keep each data point.  The default
  is 600 seconds (10 minutes).  The higher this value, the more space the raw
  data takes up.  `retention-time` can be changed after an instrumentation is
  created.

These values affect the space used by the instrumentation's data.  For example,
all things being equal, the following all store the same amount of data:

* 10 minutes' worth of per-second data (600 data points)
* 50 minutes' worth of per-5-second data
* 25 days' worth of per-hour data
* 600 days' worth of per-day data

The system imposes limits on these properties so that each instrumentation's
data cannot consume too much space.  The limits are expressed internally as a
number of data points, so you can adjust granularity and retention-time to match
your needs.  Typically, you'll be interested in either per-second data for live
performance analysis or an array of different granularities and retention-times
for historical usage patterns.

## Data persistence

By default, data collected by the CA service is only cached in memory, not
persisted on disk.  As a result, transient failures of underlying CA service
instances can result in loss of the collected data.  For live performance
analysis, this is likely not an issue, since the likelihood of a crash is low
and the data can probably be collected again.  For historical data being kept
for days, weeks, or even months, it's necessary to persist data to disk.  This
can be specified by setting the `persist-data` instrumentation property to
"true".  In that case, CA will ensure that data is persisted at approximately
the `granularity` interval of the instrumentation, but no more frequently than
every few minutes.  (For that reason, there's little value in persisting an
instrumentation whose retention time is only a few minutes.)

## Transformations

Transformations are post-processing functions that can be applied to data when
it's retrieved.  You do not need to specify transformations when you create an
instrumentation; you need only specify them when you retrieve the value.
Transformations map values of a discrete decomposition to something else.  For
example, a metric that reports HTTP operations decomposed by IP address supports
a transformation that performs a reverse-DNS lookup on each IP address so that
you can view the results by hostname instead.  Another transformation maps IP
addresses to geolocation data for displaying incoming requests on a world map.

Each supported transformation has a name, like "reversedns".  When a
transformation is requested for a value, the returned value includes a
`transformations` object with keys corresponding to each transformation (e.g.,
"reversedns").  Each of these is an object mapping keys of the discrete
decomposition to transformed values.  For example:

    {
      "value": {
        "8.12.47.107": 57
      },
      "transformations": {
        "reversedns": {
          "8.12.47.107": [ "joyent.com" ]
        }
      },
      "start_time": 1308863799,
      "duration": 1,
      "nsources": 1,
      "minreporting": 1,
      "requested_start_time": 1308863799,
      "requested_duration": 1,
      "requested_end_time": 1308863800
    }

Transformations are always performed asynchronously and the results cached
internally for future requests.  So the first time you request a transformation
like "reversedns", you may see no values transformed at all.  As you retrieve
the value again, the system will have completed the reverse-DNS lookup for
addresses in the data and they will be included in the returned value.


# Appendix C: HTTP Signature Authentication

In addition to HTTP Basic Authentication, CloudAPI supports a new
mechanism for authenticating HTTP requests based on signing with your SSH
private key.  Specific examples of using this mechanism with SDC are given here.
Reference the `HTTP Signature Authentication` specification by Joyent, Inc. for
complete details.

A node.js library for HTTP Signature is available with:

    $ npm install http-signature

## CloudAPI Specific Parameters

The `Signature` authentication scheme is based on the model that the client must
authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by the private key
associated with an SSH key under your account (see `/my/keys` above).  Currently
only RSA signatures are supported.  You generate a signature by signing the
value of the HTTP `Date` header.

As an example, assuming that you have associated an RSA SSH key with your account,
called 'rsa-1', the following request is what you would send for a `ListMachines`
request:

    GET /my/machines HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.com
    Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2011 23:56:29 GMT
    Authorization: Signature keyId="/demo/keys/rsa-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256" <Base64(rsa(sha256($Date)))>
    Accept: application/json
    X-Api-Version: ~6.5

Where the signature is attached with the
Base64(rsa(sha256(Sat, 11 Jun 2011 23:56:29 GMT))) output.  Note that the
`keyId` parameter *cannot* use the _my_ shortcut, as in the HTTP resource paths.
This is because CloudAPI must lookup your account to resolve the key, as with
Basic authentication.  In short, you *MUST* use the login name associated to
your account to specify the `keyId`.

## Sample Code

Sample code for generating the `Authorization` header (and `Date` header), now
follows.

    var crypto = require('crypto');
    var fs = require('fs');
    var https = require('https');



    /**
     * Simply pads a number < 10 with a leading 0.
     *
     * @param {String} val a numeric string.
     * @return {String} a new value that may have a leading 0.
     */
    function pad(val) {
      if (parseInt(val, 10) < 10)
        val = '0' + val;
      return val;
    }


    /**
     * Generates an RFC 1123 compliant Date String
     *
     * @return {String} RFC 1123 date string.
     */
    function httpDate() {
      var now = new Date();
      var months = ['Jan',
                    'Feb',
                    'Mar',
                    'Apr',
                    'May',
                    'Jun',
                    'Jul',
                    'Aug',
                    'Sep',
                    'Oct',
                    'Nov',
                    'Dec'];
      var days = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'];
      return days[now.getUTCDay()] + ', ' +
                  pad(now.getUTCDate()) + ' ' +
                  months[now.getUTCMonth()] + ' ' +
                  now.getUTCFullYear() + ' ' +
                  pad(now.getUTCHours()) + ':' +
                  pad(now.getUTCMinutes()) + ':' +
                  pad(now.getUTCSeconds()) +
                  ' GMT';
    }

    var file = process.env.HOME + '/.ssh/id_rsa';
    var key = fs.readFileSync(file, 'ascii');
    if (!key)
      throw new Error(file + ' was not a valid RSA key');

    var date = httpDate();
    var signer = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');
    signer.update(date);
    authz = 'Signature keyId="/mark/keys/rsa-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256" ' + signer.sign(key, 'base64');

    var request = {
